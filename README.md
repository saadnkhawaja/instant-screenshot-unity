# Instant Screenshot - Unity Asset

Capture high-quality screenshots from your Unity scenes with ease. Our Unity3D Screenshot Editor Tool is designed to streamline your development workflow by providing simple, one-click options to capture screenshots directly within the Unity Editor.

## Features

- **One-Click Capture:** Quickly snap screenshots directly from the scene view with a single click.
- **High-Definition Screenshots:** Ensure your screenshots are crisp and clear, perfect for showcasing your game's graphics.
- **Transparent Background Support:** Easily create screenshots with a transparent background for use in presentations or marketing materials.
- **Customizable Shortcuts and Hotkeys:** Speed up your workflow with user-defined shortcuts to capture screenshots without disrupting your development process.
- **API Access:** Programmatically capture screenshots from your scripts, giving you flexibility for automated processes and testing.

## How to Use

1. Download and import the `InstantScreenshot.cs` script into your Unity project.
2. Place the `InstantScreenshot.cs` file inside an `Editor` folder in your project's assets. This placement ensures that Unity compiles it as an editor script.
3. Assign hotkeys through the Unity Preferences window or use the API functions to integrate screenshot capabilities into your game's debugging tools.
